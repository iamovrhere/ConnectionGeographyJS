Connection-Geography V2
======

A means to visually represent the distribution of LinkedIn connections, moreover the distribution of “extended” connections (second connections, etc). 

Background
------

Once upon a time, I wrote a little application that used LinkedIn's API represent the distribution of LinkedIn connections geographically, with both 1st and 2nd connections. The application made use of vanilla JavaScript, Google Maps JavaScript API, and the LinkedIn PHP API. It worked and, while I still had various plans to improve on it, it accomplished the job.

Unforunately, in February 2015 [LinkedIn announced they would be eliminating some of their APIs](https://developer.linkedin.com/blog/posts/2015/developer-program-changes) for general use. There was an option to request permissions which was made and never responded to. In the end, the project was abandoned. Gone, but not forgotten.

However, still wanting this kind of functionality and not having one I decided I will try to resurrect the project, somehow. Currently my plan of action is to drop all the ancient PHP code, re-use some snippets of the HTML and JavaScript and resurrect the project as a UserScript.
